# C file from prototype program

#### Welcome to a simple program that I wrote for fun as well as to speed up writing code solutions for Holberton software engineering course projects.
The first trimester of Holberton is focused on learning C language and many of the tasks require us to write a function. Often the function prototype is provided in the question. With just this single string of text, we can extract enough data to produce a simple template file.

### Installation
`git clone` into your local directory and type `make 0`. This will create an executable called create_cfile.
